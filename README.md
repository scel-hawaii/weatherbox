Weatherbox
============================

## Motivation

This is the primary directory for the reis weatherbox project. The goal of the reis weatherbox
project is to create a cheap, easy to use and maintainable weather data collection device 
which can then be massively deployable across a university campus. 

The current firmware release is skynet-b03.

## Current collaborators:

* Kenny Luong
* Sean Hara
* Zachary Dorman
* Christie Obatake 
* Ryan Walser


## Arduino IDE Library Setup

Although efforts to move away from the arduino IDE are underway, it is still the best platform to 
develop the weatherbox. A quick note about the library -- you'll neeed to either add the 
library contents to your own arduino library folder, or just make repository your
sketchbook folder. I'd recommend the former. If you're on linux, symlinking all of the folders
in the weatherbox/libraries directory should work.
