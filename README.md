Weatherbox
============================

This is the primary directory for the reis weatherbox project. The goal of the reis weatherbox
project is to create a cheap, easy to use and maintainable weather data collection device 
which can then be massively deployable across a university campus. 

The current firmware release is skynet-b03.
